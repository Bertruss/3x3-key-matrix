the penny pincher's parts guide.  

#Parts Manifest:
teensy-LC w/ header pins, $17
	- via amazon, though I honestly don't know why I didn't just go to https://www.pjrc.com . I would see if shipping makes the difference for you. 

	
prototyping PCB, 20c	
	- any DIY parts supplier should have these
	
set of 9 transluscent keycaps (WASD, ARROWS, ESC), $6.99
	- available via amazon, probably anywhere really. the WASD ARROW ESC bundle is probably the cheapest way to buy such a small amount.
	- cheapest small set of clear MX caps I could find (<$1 per key)	
	- not all sculpted for the same row...but the bottom & middle row will be consistent 

15 1N914 Diodes, 75c
    - local DIY supplier
	- low tolerance, but anything more isn't needed
	- bought spares, only 9 needed

10 Cherry MX clear switches $8.50
	- sourced from https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/
	- bought 30 switches with a friend to bring the price down
	
This next part is a tad bit odd, but I bought an old disco mixer (audio mixer w/ mic input) from someone on craigslist
for $7. with plenty of switches, left/right VU meters, and a solid metal body, and (much to my dismay) it was terrible at it's intended purpose
and had probably been just as bad in the 80's when it was new. So I scrapped it, and though it was not my original motivation for taking it apart, it's 
enclosure became raw materials for the housing for my switch assembly. 

If you are like me, and going on the cheap and DIY, thriftstores and craigslist are fairly solid places to go digging for interesting and 
cheap building materials. Basically anything can be used to this effect if you have the proper tools to shape it. alternatively, raw materials like wood 
and sheet metal from a hardware store would probably be easier and still be inexpensive. So you should probably do that.

#Face-Plate template:
I actually found it really difficult to find information about switch spacing for plate mounted keys,
which is the only reason I used autogenerated design documents for such a simple design. they have since been modified to 
space the keys slightly farther apart.
The faceplate vector file provided is for cherry MX keyswitches.
