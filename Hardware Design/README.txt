the penny pincher's parts guide.  

#Parts Manifest:
teensy-LC w/ header pins, $17
	- via amazon, though https://www.pjrc.com might be better. I would see if shipping makes the difference for you. 
	
prototyping PCB, 20c	
	- any DIY parts supplier should have these
	
set of 9 transluscent keycaps (WASD, ARROWS, ESC), $6.99
	- available via amazon. The WASD ARROW ESC bundle is probably the cheapest way to buy such a small number of caps.
	- cheapest small set of clear MX caps I could find (<$1 per key)	
	- not all sculpted for the same row...but the bottom & middle row will be consistent 

15 1N914 Diodes, 75c
	- local DIY supplier
   	- low tolerance, but anything more isn't needed
	- bought spares, only 9 needed

10 Cherry MX clear switches $8.50
	- sourced from https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/
	- bought 30 switches with a friend to bring the price down
	
#Face-Plate template:
I actually found it really difficult to find information about switch spacing for plate mounted keys,
which is the only reason I used autogenerated design documents for such a simple design. they have since been modified to 
space the keys slightly farther apart.
The faceplate vector file provided is for cherry MX keyswitches.
