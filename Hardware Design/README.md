# Parts Manifest:
 
Teensy-LC w/ header pins, $17
 - Source: Amazon
  - Though https://www.pjrc.com might be better. I would see if shipping makes the difference for you. 
	
Prototyping PCB, 20c	
 - Source: local DIY supplier
	
Set of 9 transluscent keycaps (WASD, ARROWS, ESC), $6.99
 - Source: Amazon. 
  - The WASD ARROW ESC bundle is probably the cheapest way to buy such a small number of caps. (<$1 per cap)	
  - not all sculpted for the same row, but the bottom & middle row will be consistent.
  - alternatively you can buy individual or small packs of keycaps from pimpmykeyboard.com 

15 1N914 Diodes, 75c
 - Source: local DIY supplier
  - low tolerance, but anything more isn't needed
  - bought spares, only 9 needed

10 Cherry MX clear switches $8.50
 - Source: https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/
	- bought 30 switches with a friend to bring the price down
	- Gateron switches come highly recommended as Cherry MX clones, 
	  and are in many cases cheaper 

100 3mm flangeless diffuse white LED's (included 100 500ohm resistors) $4.50
 - Source: Ebay
	- There are certainly other options, this was the cheapest I found

# Making an enclosure
The easiest way to create an enclosure should be to use the provided model files and 3D print them, 
but I realize this might not be feasible for everyone. Alternatively, following resources can be used 
to create a faceplate file which can be used to cut an appropriate front plate to hold the switches. 
I have provided a basic vector file template for a 3x3 switch pad.   

## Face-Plate template resources
 - Key Layout generator
    - http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/
 - Faceplate vector file generator
	- http://builder.swillkb.com/
 - Vector files can be opened with the free and open source program Inkscape, available here
	- https://inkscape.org/

## Enclosure Model
 - The enclosure STL and 123D files are my attempts at an easily 3d-printable enclosure.  
 - The provided model has a length and width of 3 x 3.5 inches
