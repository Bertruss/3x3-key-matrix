# Parts Manifest:
 
Teensy-LC w/ header pins, $17
 - Source: Amazon
  - Though https://www.pjrc.com might be better. I would see if shipping makes the difference for you. 
	
Prototyping PCB, 20c	
 - Source: local DIY supplier
	
Set of 9 transluscent keycaps (WASD, ARROWS, ESC), $6.99
 - Source: Amazon. 
  - The WASD ARROW ESC bundle is probably the cheapest way to buy such a small number of caps. (<$1 per cap)	
  - not all sculpted for the same row, but the bottom & middle row will be consistent. 

15 1N914 Diodes, 75c
 - Source: local DIY supplier
  - low tolerance, but anything more isn't needed
  - bought spares, only 9 needed

10 Cherry MX clear switches $8.50
 - Source: https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/
	- bought 30 switches with a friend to bring the price down
	- Gateron switches come highly recommended as Cherry MX clones, 
	  and are in many cases cheaper 


## Face-Plate template:

## Enclosure Model
- The enclosure STL and 123D files are my attempts at an easily 3d-printable enclosure. Your mileage may vary
